## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 27th Frontend Mentor Challenge.

I tackled a Frontend Mentor coding challenge to create a sleek landing page using HTML and CSS. This project not only honed my layout skills but also enhanced my attention to detail, especially with hover states. It was a valuable experience that boosted my confidence in crafting visually appealing websites.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
